- TODO list for Revolver void-finding package

* Check if a standard version of qhull (e.g. Debian GNU/Linux
   stretch with 'aptitude install libqhull-dev libqhull7 qhull-bin'
   has version 2015.2-2) allows the revolver packages to work
   correctly. This would allow removal of qhull source code and
   compilation and make revolver more modular.

* Provide some small-scale input files and expected output files for regression
   tests for checking that the package works correctly.
